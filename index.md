## Brainstorming Prompts

**What is the most interesting topic covered in your domain this quarter?**  
The most interesting topic in this quarter was the application of llms to classify large bodies of text with minimal supervision and seed words. The LLM was able to identify in-corpus seed words that were similar to the provided ones.
A step further was the use of LLMs to compare documents implicitly using the LLM's embeddings, which are vast compared 
to a home-brewed classifier. This even eliminated the use of seed words and instead allowed the LLM to come up with 
cluster labels.

**Describe a potential investigation you would like to pursue for your Quarter 2 Project.**  
An app I'd like to develop is a deck building site for Magic: The Gathering that leverages an LLM. With thousands of 
unique cards, I'd like to find cards that synergize well together. Crafting a commander deck, with 100 unique cards,
takes a lot of drafting and playtesting before arriving at a fun result. Players have to balance card draw and mana,
building up their strategy while sabotaging others, as well as financial cost of cards. While there are sites that
can summarize what other players are doing, I'd like a smarter search that understands why certain cards are paired
together as well as evaluate the makeup of a deck/generate a deck that would perform reasonably well when considering
opponents' decks and strategies.

**What is a potential change youâ€™d make to the approach taken in your current Quarter 1 Project?**  
While I understand the novel methods of text classification presented in the papers as well as the very basic baselines that
we recreated (tfidf and word2vec), I wish there was a bit more explanation on other methods that have been developed between
the brand new models and the baselines we learned about in prior classes.

**What other techniques would you be interested in using in your project?**  
This project, especially when cards that have just been released, might need OCR to read the text off the card. However, I believe this is reasonably possible due to the structured nature of cards and where they place their text.
